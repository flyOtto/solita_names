# solita_names

I decided to use Python, since it is the language I’m most familiar with. The next decision was on what I would develop my app on and decided to use the Flask (micro-framework): easy to use, no need for the browser engine and quick to prototype. 

Create Virtual Environment with env:

python3 -m venv python_app

I always start with the virtual environment, so I won’t forget it and get into trouble in future with my python dependencies.

Next I cloned the given information local from the forked repository. Then I copied the names.json file into my own directory. I could have used the original name, but decided to move it to have my own READme.

Finally when I opened the folder on my preferred IDE, which is the Vscode, I added first thing the gitignore. I prefer doing some things in advance in order not to forget them.

Ones ready with these, I can now proceed with my project. Needless to say, I will be checking the gitignore file separately afterwards and during coding.

Then I activated the environment and started downloading necessary libraries. 

Coding part was easy, I was able to render the dataframes to HTML, but here I got stuck, when trying to use flask app to run it. I seem to have an issue with the code and run out of time, so I left the app here. 

If I would do something differently next time, would be to use javascript in frontend and do a Rest API to communicate with it. I'm more used to wrangling data than connecting it to apps.

The app should be running on localhost, port 5000. As I couldn't get the app.py to run, I was not able to verify if my paths were ok.
